## Educational react project on codecademy

The app is built as a static react app and deployed on Firebase at jammming.francescosommaruga.com

### Base project goal
The user should be able to search for tracks, select is favorites and publish them as a new playlist on his Spotify account.

### Personal edits
I chose to store the accessToken in the local storage in order to keep the session alive until the expiration of the accessToken.
